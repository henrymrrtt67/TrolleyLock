Application
	- Notification of missing trolleys/trolleys going outside of premises (100 metres out of the stores boundaries.) And a gps trigger of exactly where they are.


Microservices
	- This will have a light applications front end and a heftier business logic.


Done:
	Set up stores and trolleys controller.
	Set up cryptography and applied tests to test its functionality.
	Set up Roles and Companies and Staff controller initial creation.

To Do:
	Create more in depth return (Rather that returning Id returning the string from a separate group of dummy data. Might need to start setting up a proper business logic layer.)
	Set up payment controller
		Set up best way to not leak CC information - Cryptography or to be sent immediately from the trolley so it does not touch our business logic and just waits for a response for authorisation.
	Test API endpoints from CMD Line.

	Set up database
	Set up application(1st. Web application. 2nd. Mobile application.) front end
	
	Set up GPS.

	Potentially check for any features that the client would like.
