Microservices
	- This will have a light applications front end and a heftier business logic.


Done:
	Set up stores and trolleys controller.
	Set up cryptography and applied tests to test its functionality.

To Do:
	Set up staff controller - Just initial creation, can be expanded upon.
		- Get staff
		- Get staff by store
		- Get staff by role
	Set up payment controller
		Set up best way to not leak CC information - Cryptography or to be sent immediately from the trolley so it does not touch our business logic and just waits for a response for authorisation.
	Test API endpoints from CMD Line.
	

	Set up database
	Set up application(1st. Web application. 2nd. Mobile application.) front end
	
	Set up GPS.
